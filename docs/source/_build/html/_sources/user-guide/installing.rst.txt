Installing Ecka
===============

You can download the latest stable version of Ecka from the `download page <https://ecka.imbick.com/download>`_ or the direct link https://ecka.imbick.com/download/ecka

Once downloaded, extract the ``ecka`` folder to anywhere on your computer. We recommend `7-Zip <https://www.7-zip.org/>`_.
Inside this folder you'll find an executable named ``ecka.exe`` that will launch the application when double clicked.

Uninstalling
============

Currently Ecka doesn't make any changes to your machine outside of the ``ecka`` folder so to uninstall it you only need to delete this folder.
