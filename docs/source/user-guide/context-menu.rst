Context menu
============

When you right-click on the notification icon you will see the Ecka context menu that will list a selection of useful items that you can use to call operations on Ecka.

List of menu items
=====================

* Close
   The ``close`` item will call the :doc:`stop operation </api/service/GET-stop>` to Ecka. Once completed the application will fully exit.
* Flows
   Inside the ``Flows`` sub menu you will see a list of all the `flows </flows>`_ that have been added to Ecka. If the flow was successfully loaded you can click it which will call the :doc:`trigger operation </api/flows/GET-trigger>` for that flow.
