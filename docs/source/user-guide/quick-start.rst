Quick start
===========

Once :doc:`installed </user-guide/installing>`, you can launch Ecka from the ``ecka.exe`` in the extracted folder. This will start Ecka and place an icon in the notification area.

When running you can right-click the icon to access the context menu. From here you can select commands that will interact with Ecka.

Stopping Ecka
=============
If you want to close the Ecka application you can choose ``Close`` from the context menu. This will instruct Ecka to begin closing down.
You can also close Ecka by using the `stop command </stop>`_ via the API.
